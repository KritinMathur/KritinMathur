## üöÄ Featured Projects

### [DINO-NERF: Geometric Consistency Through Global Visual Cues](https://github.com/your-repo/dino-nerf)
- Developed a pipeline to incorporate **DINOv2 features** into **Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)**, a cutting-edge technique in 3D scene reconstruction from 2D images.
- The project enhanced **geometric consistency** by utilizing global visual cues, which improved the accuracy of depth maps and object segmentation, particularly when reconstructing scenes from novel viewpoints.
- This advancement enabled the model to maintain structural integrity of objects and spatial relationships across various perspectives, making it ideal for tasks like **3D reconstruction** in autonomous navigation and computer vision applications.

### [Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)](https://github.com/your-repo/slam-project)
- Implemented a **particle filter-based SLAM** system for indoor robotic navigation, which combined sensor data from **IMU** (Inertial Measurement Unit) and **LiDAR** to map and localize the robot in unknown environments.
- Applied the system to the humanoid robot **THOR**, developed at Penn and UCLA, achieving highly accurate 3D mapping and real-time localization.
- The system's ability to dynamically adjust to changing environments and efficiently fuse sensor data was key to improving navigation precision, applicable in autonomous robotic systems like drones or mobile robots in unstructured indoor environments.

### [Trajectory Generation and Control of a Quadrotor](https://github.com/your-repo/quadrotor-trajectory)
- Developed a complete **trajectory generation and control system** for a quadrotor UAV. This involved modeling the physical forces acting on the quadrotor and implementing **dynamic motion planning** to ensure smooth flight paths.
- Incorporated **Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO)** to track the quadrotor‚Äôs position using camera data and inertial sensors, enabling precise localization in environments without GPS.
- Designed a **geometric non-linear controller** that maintained flight stability under dynamic conditions, optimizing the quadrotor‚Äôs ability to follow pre-determined paths with accuracy. Additionally, employed **complementary filtering** for accelerometer calibration, ensuring sensor data reliability during flight.

### [Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for Walker](https://github.com/your-repo/ppo-walker)
- Implemented **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**, a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm, to train a **Walker agent** within the **MuJoCo simulator**, part of DeepMind's Control Suite.
- The goal was to achieve stable, smooth walking behavior for the agent, which required tuning the neural network's policy for controlling the Walker‚Äôs actions in real-time, learning optimal control strategies over time.
- Utilized PPO's ability to balance exploration and exploitation effectively, achieving consistent learning progress and demonstrating significant improvement in the Walker‚Äôs gait, control, and movement precision.
- This work has applications in **robotic control systems** for legged robots or other dynamic robotic agents, where stability and efficiency of movement are critical.
